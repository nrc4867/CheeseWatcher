Watches Rawb.tv for cheese

Get notifications for vitural cheese

This is a silly app that watches a livestreamer on Twitch.TV. He has a feature in his stream where you can collect cheese that appears on stream by typing in his chat. This project watches his stream and then sends a notification over a server to connected clients that a cheese is on screen. I used this to create an addroid applicaiton that notifies me, so I can collect the cheese with my phone.
